## About
UniPrompt looks at prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. In particular, it can generate long, complex prompts that baseline algorithms are unable to generate.

## Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3 (>= 3.8)

1. Install the latest version of `pip` and `setuptools`

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ```

1. To setup the package locally, run

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/UniPrompt.git
    ```

### 🔧 Setting up

1. **Set Environment Variables**

   You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables before running the code:
   
   ### Example Commands

   For **Windows Command Prompt**:
   ```cmd
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

   For **Windows PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
   ```

1. **Update the Config File**

   Modify the `config/dataset_name.json` file as per your use case. The configuration includes the following parameters:
   ```json
   {
      "dataset_path": "dataset/ethos.jsonl",
      "mini_batch": 5,
      "batch_size": 7,
      "iterations": 1,
      "epochs": 10,
      "logging_file_path": "logs/ethos.jsonl",
      "initial_prompt": "introduction: In this task, you are given a question. You have to solve the question.",
      "solver_llm": {
         "model": "gpt-4",
         "temperature": 0
      },
      "expert_llm": {
         "model": "gpt-4",
         "temperature": 0
      },
      "grouping_llm": {
         "model": "gpt-4",
         "temperature": 0
      }
   }
   ```
   Example config files can be found at [config/ethos.json](config/ethos.json) and [config/gk.json](config/gk.json).

1. **Prepare the Dataset**

   The dataset format is very important. Ensure your dataset is a JSONL file with the following format:
   - `split`: (train, test, validation)
   - `question`: Full question that you want to get answered, including any prefix or postfix statements
   - `choices`: If the answer has choices, it should be a list, like `[monkey, zebra, lion, tiger]`
   - `answer`: Either a digit or an option like `A`, `B`, `C`, etc.

   Example:
   ```jsonl
   {"split": "train", "question": "What is the largest land animal?", "choices": ["monkey", "zebra", "lion", "tiger"], "answer": "D"}
   ```

### 🚀 Running the Optimization

To get the final optimized prompt, you need to run the `optimize` function from the library:

```python
from uniprompt import optimize

with open(config_file, "r") as f:
      config = json.load(f)

final_prompt = optimize(config=config)
```

For a working example, run
```bash
python examples/main.py --config=config/gk.json
```
