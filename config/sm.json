There is no relationship between the QUERY and the KEYWORD. This includes but is not limited to: incorrect / unrelated product, unrelated topic, wrong location when location is important, cannot be used in place of query product nor are they commonly purchased together, etc.\n\nMeaning of the answer choice \"Not Bad\": The KEYWORD is relevant to the user's search QUERY. This can include: broader or narrower product selection, competitor or alternative products, accessories, products often purchased together and related topics as well as direct matches to the user's search.",
